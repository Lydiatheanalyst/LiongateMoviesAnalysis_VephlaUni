Recommendations

Focus on High-Performing Years: Given the success of 2012, analyzing what drove higher revenue that year (e.g., genre trends, specific franchises) can guide marketing and production strategies for similar future projects.

Invest in Proven Franchises: With The Hunger Games series showing both high revenue and profitability, Lionsgate could benefit from exploring potential spin-offs or sequels. Expanding partnerships around such franchises could also enhance brand loyalty and viewership.

Evaluate Budget Impact: While some high-budget movies were profitable, further analysis can determine if a strong positive correlation exists between high budgets and high revenue or if more strategic, lower-budget films might yield similar returns.

Optimize Market Targeting: With the U.S. and France showing the strongest revenue performance, Lionsgate might increase localized marketing in these regions. Additionally, expanding releases or promotions in similar markets could capture untapped audiences.

Strengthen Actor Collaborations: Jason Statham, Tyler Perry, and top revenue-contributing actors like Jennifer Lawrence have shown significant viewer appeal. Increasing collaborations with these actors, or casting them in new projects, could further engage their fan bases and potentially boost revenues.
